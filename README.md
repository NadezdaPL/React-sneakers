# **Project: Sneakers**

The online sneaker store was made to study and consolidate the skills of working with React. As well as the practice of using SCSS to reduce code and avoid multiple assignment of a class to each element.


<u>**Project includes 7 blocks:**</u>

1. Header
2. Main picture
3. Cards
4. Cart
5. Orders
6. Bookmarks
7. Footer

<u>**Technical component of the project:**</u>

* basic information was taken from the *layout in "Figma"*;
* the markup of the project was first prepared in HTML and CSS, then the project was implemented through React;
* mockapi.io server is used to store data.
<!-- * *adaptive layout* was implemented in the project to make the web page look great on all devices; -->
<!-- * for ¨flexibility¨ of the site used: *flexbox*, *grid* and *directive @media*; -->
<!-- * the project uses the JavaScript programming language; -->

<u>**Further plans to improve the project:**</u>

* make a mobile version of the site so that the project looks good on any screens;
* fix bugs in the overlay with the basket, round the amount of tax on goods in the basket, set clear sizes inside the cards;
* change the shape of the loading;
* add main picture;
* in bookmarks and orders, if there are no goods, display the corresponding message;
* in the order page, set a limit on the number of displayed purchases on the screen.
